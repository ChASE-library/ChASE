The path that leads to the current implementation of ChASE using modern
``C++`` design concepts started back in summer of 2012, when an
initial Matlab prototype of the code was implemented in ``C`` and
parallelized using OpenMP 3.0. Soon after a distributed version of the
code was implemented based on MPI and the `Elemental
<http://libelemental.org/>`__ library. The results of these
implementations lead to a the first publications on the performance of
the library on sequences of eigenvalue problems stemming from
Materials Science applications. In the following three years, a first
basic ``C++`` implementation on shared memory architectures and GPUs
was developed. Eventually all these efforts lead to the current
implementation in ``C++`` which is templated and separates algorithm
from kernel implementation through the use of an abstract class.

Approximately one year ago, the codebase underwent a major refactoring
to improve modularity and maintainability. This refactoring effort
reorganized the code structure, enhanced separation of concerns between
different components (sequential vs. parallel implementations, CPU vs.
GPU backends...), and established clearer namespace hierarchies.
These improvements have led to the current well-structured codebase that
supports multiple implementation variants (ChASECPU, ChASEGPU, pChASECPU,
pChASEGPU) with a unified interface while maintaining high performance and
extensibility. Following this refactoring, latest research efforts have
extended ChASE to support pseudo-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, which has
significantly broadened the library's applicability to new domains, such as
the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) in computational materials science.
