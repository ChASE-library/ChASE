# ChASE: a Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace Eigensolver for Dense Eigenproblems

The **Ch**ebyshev **A**ccelerated **S**ubspace **E**igensolver (ChASE) is a modern and scalable library based on subspace iteration with polynomial acceleration to solve dense Hermitian (Symmetric) algebraic eigenvalue problems, especially solving dense Hermitian eigenproblems arragend in a sequence. Novel to ChASE is the computation of the spectral estimates that enter in the filter and an optimization of the polynomial degree that further reduces the necessary floating-point operations. 

ChASE is written in C++ using the modern software engineering concepts that favor a simple integration in application codes and a straightforward portability over heterogeneous platforms. When solving sequences of Hermitian eigenproblems for a portion of their extremal spectrum, ChASE greatly benefits from the sequence’s spectral properties and outperforms direct solvers in many scenarios. The library ships with two distinct parallelization schemes, supports execution over distributed GPUs, and is easily extensible to other parallel computing architectures.

## Use Case and Features

- **Real and Complex:** ChASE is templated for real and complex numbers. So it can be used to solve *real symmetric* eigenproblems as well as *complex Hermitian* ones.
- **Eigespectrum:** ChASE algorithm is designed to solve for the *extremal portion* of the eigenspectrum of matrix `A`. The library is particularly efficient when no more than `20%` of the extremal portion of the eigenspectrum is sought after. For larger fractions the subspace iteration algorithm may struggle to be competitive. Converge could become an issue for fractions close to or larger than `50%`.
- **Type of Problem:** ChASE can currently handle only standard eigenvalue problems. 
- **Sequences:** ChASE is particularly efficient when dealing with *sequences of eigenvalue problems*, where the eigenvectors solving for one problem can be use as input to accelerate the solution of the next one.
- **Vectors input:** Since it is based on subspace iteration, ChASE can receive as input a matrix of vector equal to the number of desired eigenvalues. ChASE can experience substantial speed-ups when this input matrix contains some information about the sought after eigenvectors.
- **Degree optimization:** For a fixed accuracy level, ChASE can optimize the degree of the Chebyshev polynomial filter so as to minimize the number of FLOPs necessary to reach convergence.
- **Precision:** ChASE is also templated to work in *Single Precision* (SP) or *Double Precision* (DP).

## Builds of ChASE

ChASE supports different builds for different systems with different architectures:
   - **Shared memory build:** This is the simplest configuration and should be exclusively selected when ChASE is used on only one computing node or on a single GPU. 
   - **MPI+Threads build:** On multi-core homogeneous CPU clusters, ChASE is best used in its pure MPI build. In this configuration, ChASE is typically used with one MPI rank per NUMA domain and as many threads as number of available cores per NUMA domain.
   - **Multi-GPU build:** ChASE can be configured to take advantage of GPUs on heterogeneous computing clusters. Currently we support the use of one GPU per MPI rank. Multiple-GPU per computing node can be used when MPI rank number per node equals to the GPU number per node. 
      - **NCCL Backend:** by default, ChASE uses **[NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)** as backend for the collective communications across different GPUs.
      - **CUDA-Aware MPI Backend**: alternatively, CUDA-Aware MPI can be used for the communications.

## Supported Data types 
   
   ChASE  supports different data types:
   - **Shared memory build** requires dense matrices to be column major.
   - **Distributed-memory build** support two types of data distribution of matrix `A` across 2D MPI/GPU grid:
      - **Block Distribution**:  each MPI rank of 2D grid is assigned a block of dense matrix **A**.
      - **Block-Cyclic Distribution**: an distribution scheme for implementation of dense matrix computations on distributed-memory machines, to improve the load balance of matrix computation if the amount of work differs for different entries of a matrix.

## Contribution

This Github repository mirrors the principal Gitlab repository hosted at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre. There are two main ways you can contribute: 

1. you can fork the open source ChASE repository on Github (https://github.com/ChASE-library/ChASE). Modify the source code (and relative inlined documentation, if necessary) and then submit a pull request. If you have not contributed to the ChASE library before, we will ask you to agree to a Collaboration Agreement (CLA) before the pull request can be approved. Currentlly there is no automatic mechanism to sign such an agreement and we need you to download the file CLA.pdf (that is part of the repository), print it, sign it, scan it and send it back to chase@fz-juelich.de. Upon reception of your signed CLA, your pull request will be reviewed and then eventually approved.
2. Alternatively, if you want to contribute as a developer stably integrated into this project please contact us at chase@fz-juelich.de with a motivated request of collaboration. We will consider your request and get in touch with you to evaluate if and how to give you access directly to the Gitlab repository where the major developments of this software is carried out.

An automatic process to approve a pull request and sign a CLA is under development and will soon substitute option 1. In the meantime, we ask you for your patience and understanding in having to follow such a time consuming procedure.
