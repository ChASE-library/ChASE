//! A derived class of Chase to implement ChASE based on MPI and Dense Linear Algebra (**DLA**) routines.
  /*!
    This is a calls derived from the Chase class which plays the
      role of interface for the kernels used by the library. 
      - All members of the Chase class are virtual functions. These
      functions are re-implemented in the ChaseMpi
      class.
      - All the members functions of ChaseMpi, which are the implementation of the virtual functions in class Chase, 
        are implemented using the *DLA* routines provided by the class ChaseMpiDLAInterface.
      -  The DLA functions in ChaseMpiDLAInterface are also vritual functions, which are differently implemented targeting different
      computing architectures (sequential/parallel, CPU/GPU, shared-memory/distributed-memory, etc). In the class ChaseMpi, the calling of DLA functions are indeed
      calling their implementations from different derived classes. Thus this ChaseMpi 
      class is able to have customized implementation for various architectures.
      - For the implementation of the class ChaseMpi targeting distributed-memory platforms based
      on MPI, the setup of MPI environment and communication scheme,
      and the distribution of data (matrix, vectors) across MPI nodes are following the ChaseMpiProperties class,
      the distribution of matrix can be either **Block** or **Block-Cyclic** scheme.
      @tparam MF: A class derived from ChaseMpiDLAInterface, which indicates the selected implementation of DLA that to be used by ChaseMpi Object.
      @tparam T: the scalar type used for the application. ChASE is templated
      for real and complex numbers with both Single Precision and Double Precision,
      thus `T` can be one of `float`, `double`, `std::complex<float>` and 
      `std::complex<double>`.
