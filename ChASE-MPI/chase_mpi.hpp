//! @brief A derived class of Chase to implement ChASE based on MPI and Dense
//! Linear Algebra (**DLA**) routines.
/*!
  This is a calls derived from the Chase class which plays the
    role of interface for the kernels used by the library.
    - All members of the Chase class are virtual functions. These
    functions are re-implemented in the ChaseMpi
    class.
    - All the members functions of ChaseMpi, which are the implementation of the
  virtual functions in class Chase, are implemented using the *DLA* routines
  provided by the class ChaseMpiDLAInterface.
    -  The DLA functions in ChaseMpiDLAInterface are also vritual functions,
  which are differently implemented targeting different computing architectures
  (sequential/parallel, CPU/GPU, shared-memory/distributed-memory, etc). In the
  class ChaseMpi, the calling of DLA functions are indeed calling their
  implementations from different derived classes. Thus this ChaseMpi class is
  able to have customized implementation for various architectures.
    - For the implementation of the class ChaseMpi targeting distributed-memory
  platforms based on MPI, the setup of MPI environment and communication scheme,
    and the distribution of data (matrix, vectors) across MPI nodes are
  following the ChaseMpiProperties class, the distribution of matrix can be
  either **Block** or **Block-Cyclic** scheme.
    @tparam MF: A class derived from ChaseMpiDLAInterface, which indicates the
  selected implementation of DLA that to be used by ChaseMpi Object.
    @tparam T: the scalar type used for the application. ChASE is templated
    for real and complex numbers with both Single Precision and Double
  Precision, thus `T` can be one of `float`, `double`, `std::complex<float>` and
    `std::complex<double>`.

       The private members of this classes are initialized by the parameters of
       this constructor.
       - For the
       variable `N_`, it is initialized by the first parameter of this
       constructor `N`.
       - The variables `nev_` and
       and `nex_` are initialized by the parameters of this constructor `nev`
       and `nex`, respectively.
       - The variable `rank_` is set to be 0 since non MPI is supported. The
       variable `locked_` is initially set to be 0.
       - The variable `config_` is setup by the constructor of ChaseConfig which
       takes the parameters `N`, `nev` and `nex`.
       - The variable `matrices_` is setup directly by the constructor of
       ChaseMpiMatrices which takes the paramter `H`, `ldh`, `N`, `nev`, `nex`,
       `V1`, `ritzv`, `V2` and `resid`.
       - The variable `dla_` is initialized by `MF` which is a derived class
       of ChaseMpiDLAInterface. In ChASE, the candidates of `MF` for non-MPI
       case are the classes `ChaseMpiDLABlaslapackSeq`,
       `ChaseMpiDLABlaslapackSeqInplace` and `ChaseMpiDLACudaSeq`.

       @param N: size of the square matrix defining the eigenproblem.
       @param nev: Number of desired extremal eigenvalues.
       @param nex: Number of eigenvalues augmenting the search space. Usually a
       relatively small fraction of `nev`.
       @param H: a pointer to the memory which stores local part of matrix on
       each MPI rank. If `H` is not provided by the user, it will be internally
       allocated in ChaseMpiMatrices class.
       @param ldh: leading dimension of `H`
       @param V1: a pointer to a rectangular matrix of size `N * (nev+nex)`.
       If `V1` is not provided by the user, it will be internally allocated in
       ChaseMpiMatrices class.
       After the solving step, the first `nev` columns of `V1` are overwritten
       by the desired Ritz vectors.
       @param ritzv: a pointer to an array to store the computed Ritz values.
       If `ritzv` is not provided by the user, it will be internally allocated
       in ChaseMpiMatrices class. Its minimal size should be `nev+nex`.
       @param V2: a pointer to anther rectangular matrix of size `N *
       (nev+nex)`. f `V2` is not provided by the user, it will be internally
       allocated in ChaseMpiMatrices class.
       @param resid: a pointer to an array to store the residual of computed
       eigenpairs. If `resid` is not provided by the user, it will be internally
       allocated in ChaseMpiMatrices class. Its minimal size should be
       `nev+nex`.

       The private members of this classes are initialized by the parameters of
       this constructor.
       - For the
       variable `N_`, `nev_` and `nex_` are initialized by the first parameter
       of this constructor `properties_`.
       - The variable `rank_` is initialized by `MPI_Comm_rank`. The variable
       `locked_` is initially set to be 0.
       - The variable `config_` is setup by the constructor of ChaseConfig which
       takes the parameters `N`, `nev` and `nex`.
       - The variable `matrices_` is constructed by the `create_matrices`
       function defined in ChaseMpiProperties.
       - The variable `dla_` for the distributed-memory is initialized by the
       constructor of ChaseMpiDLA which takes both `properties_` and `MF`. In
       MPI case, the implementation of are split into two classses:
          - the class ChaseMpiDLA implements mainly the MPI collective
       communication part of ChASE with MPI support.
          - The local computation tasks within each MPI is implemented by
       another two classes derived also from the class ChaseMpiDLAInterface:
       ChaseMpiDLABlaslapack for pure-CPUs version and ChaseMpiDLAMultiGPU
       for multi-GPUs version.
          - Thus, for this constructor, a combination of ChaseMpiDLA and one of
       ChaseMpiDLABlaslapack and ChaseMpiDLAMultiGPU is required.

       @param properties: an object of ChaseMpiProperties which setups the MPI
       environment and data distribution scheme for ChaseMpi targeting
       distributed-memory systems.
       @param H: a pointer to a local matrix of the distributed
       Symmetric/Hermtitian matrix to be diagonalised. It should be provided and
       allocated by users. The minimal dimension is `mxn`, in which `m` and `n`
       can be obtained through ChaseMpiProperties::get_m() and
       ChaseMpiProperties::get_n().
       @param ldh: leading dimension of local matrix `H`, it should be `>=`
       ChaseMpiProperties::get_m()
       @param V1: a pointer to a rectangular matrix of size `m * (nev+nex)`.
       `m` can be obtained through ChaseMpiProperties::get_m().
       `V1` is partially
       distributed within each `column communicator` and is redundant among
       different `column communicator`.
       If `V1` is not provided by the user, it will be internally allocated in
       ChaseMpiMatrices class.
       After the solving step, the first `nev` columns of `V1` are overwritten
       by the desired Ritz vectors.
       @param ritzv: a pointer to an array to store the computed Ritz values.
       If `ritzv` is not provided by the user, it will be internally allocated
       in ChaseMpiMatrices class. Its minimal size should be `nev+nex`.
       @param V2: a pointer to anther rectangular matrix of size `n *
       (nev+nex)`. `V2` is partially
       distributed within each `row communicator` and is redundant among
       different `row communicator`.
       If `V2` is not provided by the user, it will be internally
       allocated in ChaseMpiMatrices class. `m` can be obtained through
       ChaseMpiProperties::get_n().

       eigenpairs. If `resid` is not provided by the user, it will be internally
