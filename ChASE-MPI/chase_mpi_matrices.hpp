 *  Utility class for Buffers
 */
//! A class to setup the buffers of matrices and vectors which will be used by ChASE-MPI.
/*!
  This class provides two constructors:
  - Allocating the buffers for ChaseMpi without MPI support.
  - Allocating the buffers for ChaseMpi with MPI support.
  @tparam T: the scalar type used for the application. ChASE is templated
    for real and complex scalar with both Single Precision and Double Precision,
    thus `T` can be one of `float`, `double`, `std::complex<float>` and 
    `std::complex<double>`.

 public:
  // Non-MPI case: Allocate everything
  //! A constructor of ChaseMpiMatrices for **Non-MPI case** which allocates everything required.
  /*!
    The **private members** of this class are initialized by the parameters of this constructor.
    - For `H__` and `H_`, they are of size `N * N`.
    - For `V1__`, `V1_`, `V2__` and `V1_`, they are of size `N * max_block`.
    - For `ritzv__`, `ritzv_`, `resid__` and `resid_`, they are of size `max_block`.
    @param N: size of the square matrix defining the eigenproblem.
    @param max_block: Maximum column number of matrix `V1_` and `V2_`. It equals to `nev_ + nex_`.
    @param V1: a pointer to the buffer `V1_`.
    @param ritz: a pointer to the buffer `ritz_`.
    @param H: a pointer to the buffer `H_`.
    @param V2: a pointer to the buffer `V2_`.
    @param resid: a pointer to the buffer `resid_`.
