The folders for the new version are created. The files are to be structured in separate folder according to extension (source files, headers, kernels, .o files). The notable exception, are the files containing main functions (drivers), which are (to be) separated in the "example drivers" folder, which contains subfolders for each version separately.

This might create a bit of confusion at the beginning, but it will keep the code much tidier and easier to use in a form of a library.
